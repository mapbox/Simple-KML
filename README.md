# Simple KML: Cocoa parsing library for Keyhole Markup Language

Simple KML is a simple & lightweight parsing library for KML written in Objective-C for the iOS platform.

It is not meant for *drawing*, but rather for *parsing*. That is, it is up to the developer to turn the data structures returned by Simple KML into drawing code, be it for annotations in MapKit, constructs in an external mapping library, drawing paths on a `UIImage`, or otherwise.

Simple KML is basically an XML parser with smarts about KML. It presents a hierarchical view of KML data and can turn things like Simple KML color definitions into `UIColor` and text coordinates into `CLLocation` so that you don't have to.

## Requirements

Simple KML has been designed & built for iOS 3.2 and greater. There's no particular reason it couldn't be adapted to Mac OS X; it just hasn't been done yet out of lack of necessity. 

Simple KML depends on [TouchXML](https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchXML), an Objective-C library for DOM-based XML parsing based on `libxml2`, and [Objective-Zip](http://code.google.com/p/objective-zip/), a library for working with archive files, both of which are included in the download.

## Features

* Support for most of the base KML entities.

    Basic support for `Object`, `Feature`, `Placemark`, `Container`, `Document`, `Folder`, `Geometry`, `Point`, `LineString`, `LinearRing`, `Polygon`, `StyleSelector`, `Style`, `SubStyle`, `BalloonStyle`, `ColorStyle`, `LineStyle`, `PolyStyle`, and `IconStyle`.

* Simple invocation.

    `SimpleKML *myKML = [SimpleKML KMLWithContentsOfFile:@"/path/to/file.kml" error:&error]`  
    `SimpleKML *myKML = [SimpleKML KMLWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/file.kml"] error:&error]`  

* Support for KMZ archives. 

    Currently searches for a top-level KML file in the archive and retrieves icon data for bundled `IconStyle` entities.

* Cocoa-native behavior.

    Native types:

    `SimpleKMLLineStyle *lineStyle = myPolygon.lineStyle; UIColor *lineColor = lineStyle.color;`  
    `NSArray *polygonPoints = myPolygon.outerBoundary.coordinates; // CLLocation objects`  
    `UIColor *textColor = myPlacemark.style.balloonStyle.textColor;`  
    `UIImage *icon = myPlacemark.style.iconStyle.icon; // planned: automatically apply scale, heading, and parent style color`  

    Intelligent parsing:

    `SimpleKMLStyle *inlineStyle = myPlacemark.inlineStyle; // within <Placemark>`  
    `SimpleKMLStyle *sharedStyle = myPlacemark.sharedStyle; // common to <Document>; no need to reference <StyleUrl>`  
    `SimpleKMLStyle *activeStyle = myPlacemark.style; // the inline style overrides the shared style`  

    `SimpleKMLGeometry *geometry = myPlacemark.geometry; // <Point>, <Polygon>, <LineString>, <MultiGeometry> etc.`  
    `SimpleKMLPoint *point = myPlacemark.point; // shortcut if <Point> exists for <Placemark>`  

    Smart error handling:

    `NSError *error;`  
    `SimpleKML *myKML = [SimpleKML KMLWithContentsOfFile:@"invalid.kml" error:&error];`  
    `if (error) { NSLog(@"%@", error); } // SimpleKMLParseError: Improperly formed KML (LinearRing has less than four coordinates)`  

    Debugging:

    `gdb: po [mySimpleKMLObject source] // protected variable containing original XML source`  

    Hierarchies:

    `SimpleKMLDocument *document = myPlacemark.document;`  
    `NSArray *documentFeatures = document.features;`  

## Usage

Include all of the Simple KML files in your Xcode project, as well as the files in the TouchXML and Objective-Zip subdirectories if you don't already use these in your project.

Per TouchXML's [installation guide](http://foobarpig.com/iphone/touchxml-installation-guide.html), add `/usr/include/libxml2` to your "Header Search Paths" and `-lxml2` to your "Other Linker Flags" since TouchXML depends on `libxml2`.

You'll also need to link against `CoreLocation.framework` for a couple of the classes since they make use of Core Location constructs.

## Plans, needs, bugs, etc.

If you find a bug or want to otherwise contribute, please fork the project on GitHub and contribute that way. In particular, I would like to start adding built-in testing with a library of accompanying KML test files to parse. 

There is an ARC-compatible branch in the works at `dev-arc`. It will eventually become `master` over time.
